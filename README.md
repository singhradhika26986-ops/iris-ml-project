# Iris Flower ML Project 

This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements.

The model is trained using the famous Iris dataset and a Random Forest classifier.  
It also includes data visualization to help understand the distribution of flower features.
